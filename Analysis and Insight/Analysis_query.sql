     Calculates support, confidence, and lift.

                                   Total No of Transaction
     Confidence : Given product A, how often is B also bought

                 Confidence  = No of Transaction containing A and B
                                 ────────────────────────────────-
                                  No of Transaction containing A

     Lift      : How much more likely vs random chance, if the relationship is actually meaningful or coincidence

                                   Confidence
